Setup Guide for CorsoDB Application Framework (UNOFFICIAL, FOR BETA TESTING ONLY)!!!

1. Add the SQL database to your SQL server via the SQL Dump file included in the root dir (This is called “corsodb.sql”).
2. Add the username “corsodb” and password “iPhone3GS” with “localhost” to the database you just created.
3. Load the project at http://localhost/corso-db

Edit the code as you will - the theming and CSS is largely based on Bootstrap 3.3.5, and updates and modifications will be pushed in updates.

This is an initial copy, but as the beta progresses, updates will be pushed using a Git repository. You can clone it using the address “https://github.com/DTMalfalfa/corso-db.git” (without the quotes).

An overview of the project is available at https://github.com/DTMalfalfa/corso-db.

Any questions or comments or support items can be emailed to me (dtmalfalfa@gmail.com), and code suggestions should be submitted via the Git forking option - forwarding a link to the fork, of course.

If code that is submitted is used in my project, all contributors will be properly credited, and will be asked before code is merged with the main project files.

Cheers for testing and have fun!
